## 🚀 Overview

**Mess-Metric** is a comprehensive solution designed to bridge the gap between students and mess management. By digitizing the feedback loop and gamifying food sustainability, we aim to drastically reduce food waste in college campuses.

We use **Google Gemini AI** to analyze student feedback in real-time, categorizing reviews by sentiment and severity to give mess managers actionable insights instantly.

* **Gamified Sustainability:** Earn **Mess Coins** for consistent reviews and "Zero Waste" streaks.
* **Leaderboard:** Compete with peers to become the monthly "Green Champion".
* **Menu & Rebates:** Check daily menus and apply for meal rebates instantly.

### 👨‍🍳 **For Admins/Managers**
* **Live Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize feedback trends and waste data.
* **Severity Alerts:** Instant highlighting of critical negative feedback (e.g., "Stale food").
